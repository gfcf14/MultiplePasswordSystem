# MultiplePasswordSystem
This is a login system that allows the user for password reset, remembering a set number of passwords, using both mySQLi or PDO

How to use:

- Note that the file globals.php, inside the PHP folder, controls several key values.
- To test out the inserting and updating, it would be easier to comment out the lines that encrypt the passwords (found at /PHP/signup.php, /PHP/mysqli/changepassword.php, and /PHP/pdo/changepassword.php).
